# Neo4j-Rails

This was an early library for experimenting with Rails 3 and Neo4j.
The ideas here have since been [included in the main neo4j Ruby library](https://github.com/andreasronge/neo4j).
You should use it for all future Neo4j+Rails work.

To view the prior contents of this library (for posterity), [follow
